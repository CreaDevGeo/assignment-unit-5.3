      <li>In the stretch goals I left off at the adding an array of tracks task. I thought this feature would work best as a function but I got a bit carried a way and spent a lot of time trying to get the function to work properly.
      Some issues im having with the track function is that it just replaces whatever the element is in the track property of each individual array rather than adding on. I also couldn't figure out how to get the conditional to
      to work the way I wanted, so if the user enters the information wrong, there will be an error for my addTrack function. I know I can eventually figure all of this out and I'm not too far away from completing the strecth goals section, but I honestly just want to move on to different assignments or next unit because I've spent a lot of time on this already.
      No questions at all, just wanted to let whoever was reviewing this know what was going on in my code. Thank you! </li>
